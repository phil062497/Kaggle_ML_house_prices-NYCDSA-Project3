Objectives 
- Produce powerful models with high predictive power for this competition
- Polish OOP skills in creating different classes and functions to preprocess, munge, transform data
- Develop stronger fundamental understanding of inner working of different ML models and strengths and weaknesses of each 

Kaggle Evaluation

"Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)"

Project Flow:
i.	Data exploration 
ii.	Data cleaning
iii.	Feature engineering
iv.	Fitting the data
v.	Hyper-parameter tuning
vi.	Stacking the level 0 models into a level 1 model
